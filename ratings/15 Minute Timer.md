## 🔍 Summary

The Canva AI-generated timer meets all functional requirements, counting down from 15 minutes with both sound effects and engaging visual animations. While readability could be improved with multiple files, the single-file constraint was handled well. The code is easy to follow, and minor improvements could make it even cleaner. The addition of creative animations and color changes goes beyond a basic timer, making the project stand out.
