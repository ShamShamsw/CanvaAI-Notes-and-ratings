**Prompt Given to Canva AI:**  
> Create an interactive biology quiz for middle school students that tests knowledge of basic concepts like cell structure, photosynthesis, and animal classification. Use emojis as visual elements throughout the quiz - 🌱 for plants, 🦠 for cells, 🧫 for lab cultures, and 🧬 for DNA. Track progress with a growing plant (🌱→🌿→🌳) that develops as students answer correctly. Include three difficulty levels with age-appropriate questions. Use a nature-themed color palette with greens and blues, and animate microscopic emoji cells (🔬+🦠) floating in the background. When students complete the quiz, celebrate their achievement with floating leaf emojis (🍃) and display a digital “Junior Biologist” badge with science emojis (🔬🧪🧬).
