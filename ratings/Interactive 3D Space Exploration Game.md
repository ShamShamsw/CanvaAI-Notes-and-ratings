## üîç Summary

The Canva AI-generated Interactive 3D Space Exploration Game is an exciting concept but falls short in execution. The code is clean and easy to read, and it launches quickly, but the core gameplay does not function as intended. While information about one planet is accurate, the game lacks the broader interactivity and features expected from a 3D exploration game. The creative concept is strong, but the lack of working gameplay significantly limits the project‚Äôs value.
