## üîç Summary

The Canva AI-generated Interactive Flashcard Game delivers a functional and easy-to-use flashcard experience. The interface and code are clean and straightforward, making it accessible for users and developers alike. However, there is a flaw in the scoring logic that allows the correct/incorrect count to exceed the number of cards, which affects reliability. While the concept is standard, it provides a solid foundation for further enhancements.
