**Prompt Given to Canva AI:**  
> Create a modern “build your own order” interactive menu without images. Start with an example for “Bella Cucina” featuring appetizers ($8-12), pastas ($14-18 with protein add-ons), and desserts ($6-9). Use clean typography and color-coding instead of photos for a sophisticated look. Do not include “Place Order” or other non-functional buttons.As a follow up ask me about: my restaurant name/concept, food categories and customization options, base items and add-ons with prices, special options (spice levels, dietary preferences).
